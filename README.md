### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As a Python developer experienced in Odoo, Flask, Django, and FastAPI, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a strong team-oriented mindset to the field of software development. Although my background is not in mechanical engineering, I have a solid foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I am constantly eager to learn and expand my knowledge in these areas to tackle complex software problems effectively.

My strong analytical abilities, coupled with my teamwork and collaboration skills, enable me to approach projects with a holistic perspective and deliver high-quality results. I am driven by a passion for creating innovative solutions that have a real-world impact. Thriving in fast-paced and dynamic environments, I am always enthusiastic about learning new technologies.

You can check my GitHub profile for examples of my work. I look forward to connecting with potential collaborators and employers on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marwen-weslati/).
